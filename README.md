This thesis presents an innovative approach to dynamic route planning using voice data 
and advanced optimization algorithms. The system processes recorded conversations to 
transcribe and extract addresses using Named Entity Recognition (NER) model. These 
addresses are geocoded and integrated into an updated dataset of locations. Traffic 
conditions are analyzed to generate a dynamic time matrix, which, along with historical 
data correlations, serves as input for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The 
Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm along with other meta-heuristic algorithms 
were employed to find efficient routes, showcasing improved operational efficiency and 
decision-making in urban logistics.
